That's really interesting to take part in the 'springtime' projects, to grow up something from the beginning. Much better than writing some boring enterprise code, isn't it, ha? Apple AppStore market looks promising for single developer, and I've  started developing my own iOS apps. And, your guess what, I've faced a common problem: one man is no man. Design, marketing, user support - that really eats up tons of time and effort.

Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day.

I've found that it is extremely hard to find a talented partner, ready to work hard and take share in projects profit. Hiring a freelancer is not a good solution to bring some more warriors to the front, so.. I've spent a lot of time in some of the cofounder's seeking websites. Nothing.
